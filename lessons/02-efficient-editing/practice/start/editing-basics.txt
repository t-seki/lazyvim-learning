Editing Fundamentals Practice
=============================

Practice using f, t, F, T commands:
-----------------------------------------
Navigate to specific characters in this line: (parentheses), [brackets], {braces}, "quotes"
Use fx to jump to x, then ; to repeat, and , to go back

Practice deletion with d operator:
-----------------------------------------
Delete unnecessary words in this extra sentence with too many unnecessary words.
Remove the (error) text inside these parentheses but keep the parentheses.
Delete from here â†’ to the end of this line using d$

Practice change with c operator:
-----------------------------------------
Change oldVariable to newVariable in this line.
Replace the "old string" with a new string using ci"
Transform function oldFunction() { return old; } to use 'new' instead of 'old'

Practice yanking and pasting:
-----------------------------------------
Copy this line and paste it below (use yy and p)
Copy just this [WORD] and paste it here: ___
Duplicate this entire function:
function original() {
    return "copy me";
}

Practice with text objects:
-----------------------------------------
Delete the content inside these quotes: "delete only this text"
Change everything inside these parentheses: (change all of this)
Delete this entire <tag>including the tags</tag>
Modify the arguments in this function: calculate(oldArg1, oldArg2, oldArg3)

Practice visual mode selection:
-----------------------------------------
Select and delete these three words
Select these
three lines
and delete them

Use visual block mode to add semicolons to these lines:
const a = 1
const b = 2
const c = 3
const d = 4

Practice the dot command:
-----------------------------------------
Change this_word to another word, then use . to change this_word and this_word

Transform these variables from camelCase to snake_case:
firstName -> first_name (manually)
lastName -> ??? (use dot command)
phoneNumber -> ??? (use dot command)
emailAddress -> ??? (use dot command)
