Welcome to Neovim! This file is for practicing basic movement and modes.

First, let's practice moving around with hjkl keys:
- Use h to move left
- Use j to move down  
- Use k to move up
- Use l to move right

Try navigating to different words in this paragraph using the hjkl keys.
Notice how you can move character by character through the text.

Now let's practice word-based movement:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Use w to jump forward word by word.
Use b to jump backward word by word.
Use e to jump to the end of words.

Practice line movement commands:
    This line starts with spaces. Use ^ to jump to the first non-blank character.
Use 0 to jump to the beginning of the line.
Use $ to jump to the end of this line right here.

Let's practice entering Insert mode:
[] <- Position your cursor between these brackets and press i to insert
() <- Position your cursor after ( and press a to append
{} <- Position your cursor on { and press A to append at line end

Here's a list where you can practice o and O commands:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Practice deletion:
Delete this x character using x command
Delete this whole line using dd command
Delete this word using dw command

Remember:
- Press ESC to return to Normal mode after inserting text
- Use :w to save your changes
- Use :q to quit (or :q! to quit without saving)
- Use u to undo any mistakes

Happy practicing!
