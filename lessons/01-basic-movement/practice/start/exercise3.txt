Word Movement Practice
=====================

Using w, b, and e commands, navigate to the marked words and capitalize their first letter.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog was very lazy indeed.

function calculateSum(numbers) {
    let total = 0;
    for (const number of numbers) {
        total += number;
    }
    return total;
}

const userConfig = {
    name: "john doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
    role: "developer",
    active: true
};
      ^^^^                     ^^^^^^^^^

// navigate to each marked word and use 'r' to replace the first character
// For example: position on 'q' in 'quick' and type 'rQ' to make it 'Quick'
