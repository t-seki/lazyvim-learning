Operator and Motion Combinations
=================================

Task: Practice combining operators (d, c, y) with various motions

1. Word-based Operations
------------------------
Delete these unnecessary extra words from this overly verbose sentence.
Change oldMethod to newMethod throughout this line: obj.oldMethod().oldMethod().oldMethod()
Copy this important phrase and paste it at the marked location below.

PASTE HERE: _______________

2. Line Operations  
------------------
This line should be deleted entirely.
This line needs to be changed to something else.
Copy this entire line and duplicate it below.

3. Using f/t Motions
--------------------
Remove everything after the comma, but keep the comma itself.
Delete from here until the semicolon at the end;
Change the text between the equals sign = and the semicolon;

const value = "change only this part";
const result = calculate(a, b, c); // delete from 'calculate' to before semicolon

4. Paragraph Operations
-----------------------
This is the first paragraph that contains some text.
It has multiple lines that should be treated as one unit.
Delete this entire paragraph using d}.

This is the second paragraph.
Copy this entire paragraph using y}.
Then paste it below.

5. Advanced Combinations
------------------------
function oldFunction(param1, param2) {
    // Delete this entire function body
    const result = param1 + param2;
    console.log("Old implementation");
    return result;
}

// Change each URL in these strings
const api1 = "https://old-api.com/v1/users";
const api2 = "https://old-api.com/v1/posts";  
const api3 = "https://old-api.com/v1/comments";

6. Counting with Operations
----------------------------
Delete exactly 3 words from here: one two three four five six
Change the next 2 occurrences of 'x': x-coordinate and x-value in x-axis
Copy 4 lines starting from this line.
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
